        Hello! I'm a passionate learner that plays around with topics from music
        theory to web design and everything in between. I am considering a
        career in AI safety, but I don't have any set-in-stone plans. I would
        like to contribute to the community around me while being able to
        explore new ideas within my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am a high school student primarily learning higher-level
        math and statistics while still enjoying the opportunities available for
        me to explore different interests.
      </p>

        exploring!
