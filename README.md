## Who I am

Hi! I'm Russell, also known as JapanColorado. I am an aspiring AI researcher, machine learning engineer, front end developer, and roboticist. I enjoy creating cool things, cuddling with my cat, and learning something new everyday!

### Why I started this blog

I've always been interested in coding and the like, but I've never been able to consistently make interesting things. I would say that I wanted to do and make awe-inspiring things, and then never put in the time and effort.

So, I'm making this blog. I will be consistently writing about the new things I'm learning, the fun projects I'm working on, and the inevitable struggles that will come up, so that you don't have to repeat my mistakes.

In addition, I will be streaming my coding sessions every other day on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@japancolorado), and I would appreciate any feedback!

I expect a long, miserable, and gruelling journey, full of twists, turns, mistakes, poorly-optimized code, and more. And I'm very excited to get started!
